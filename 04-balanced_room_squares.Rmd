# Balanced Room Squares

BIBDs and BRBs
--------------

A ***balanced incomplete block design (BIBD)*** is an arrangement of
elements (varieties) from a set $S$ of size $v$, into $b$ subsets
(blocks) each of size $k$ such that each variety occurs in $r$ blocks
and any particular pair of distinct varieties occurs in $\lambda$
blocks.

#### Example 5.1.1
$$\{a,b,c\},\{a,b,d\},\{a,c,e\},\{a,d,f\},\{a,e,f\},\{b,c,f\},\{b,d,e\},\{b,e,f\},\{c,d,e\},\{c,d,f\}$$
This is a BIBD with parameters: $v = 6$, $b = 10$, $k = 3$, $r = 5$,
$\lambda = 2$.

In any $BIBD(v, b, r, k, \lambda)$ there are $b$ blocks each containing $k$
elements, so $bk$ elements in total. Also, each of the $v$ elements
occurs $r$ times, so there are $rv$ elements in total. Therefore:
$$bk = vr$$ Also in a particular block, any element makes a pair with
$k - 1$ other elements, and each element occurs in $r$ blocks, so there
are $r(k - 1)$ pairs involving that element. Also, by definition, that
element is paired with each of the other $v - 1$ members of $S$ $\lambda$
times, so: $$\lambda (v - 1) = r(k - 1)$$ The second expression rearranges
to give $r = \lambda (v - 1)/(k - 1)$, which can be substituted into the first
expression to give $b=v\lambda (v - 1)/k(k - 1)$. So $b$ amd $r$ are both
determined by the values of $v$, $k$ and $\lambda$. For this reason we
need only quote those three parameters when referring to a particular
block design. The example was a $BIBD(6, 3, 2)$ (or $(6, 3, 2)$design).

In any Room square, the pairs $\{x,y\}$ are unordered. If we replace
these pairs by one of the ordered pairs $(x,y)$ or $(y,x)$ we call the
resulting array an ***ordered Room square (ORS)***.

Consider the following ordered Room square:

   $\infty 0$       62           54                        31                   
  ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------
                $\infty 1$       03           65                        42      
                             $\infty 2$       14           06                        53
       64                                 $\infty 3$       25           10      
                    05                                 $\infty 4$       36           21
       32                        16                                 $\infty 5$       40
       51           43                        20                                 $\infty 6$

**Figure 27**

Suppose we extract the blocks of a design (not necessarily a BIBD) from
this square in one of the two following ways:

1.  As *half-columns*. This means taking all left hand members of pairs
    from a particular column as the members of one block, and all right
    hand members as another block.

2.  By *half-rows*. Take all left members from a particular row as one
    block, and all right members as another block.

Notice that for this example, both methods generate exactly the same
blocks.
$$\{\infty,6,5,3\},\{0,2,4,1\},\{\infty,0,6,4\},\{1,3,5,2\},\{\infty,1,0,5\},\{2,4,6,3\},\{6, \infty,2,1\},$$
$$\{4,3,5,0\},\{0,\infty,3,2\},\{5,4,6,1\},\{3,1,\infty,4\},\{2,6,5,0\},\{5,4,2,\infty\},\{1, 3,0,6\}$$
Certainly this design seems to have the appropriate parameters to
qualify as a BIBD. The original Room square was based on 8 elements,
hence $v=8$. Also, the Room squareâ€™s seven rows each produced 2 blocks
of 4 elements, hence $b=14$ and $k=4$. Finally, each element occurred
once in each row of the Room square, therefore in half the total number
of blocks, hence $r=7$. $$bk=4\cdot 14 = 7 \cdot 8 = vr$$ So this design
is a BIBD, provided: $$\lambda = \frac{r(k-1)}{v-1} = \frac{7(3)}{7}=3$$
In other words, provided each pair of elements occurs in precisely 3
blocks.

By definition a ***balanced Room square [$BRS(n)$]*** is an ordered Room
square based on $n$ elements whose corresponding block design, derived
as above, is a BIBD.

Complete Balanced Howell Rotations
----------------------------------

Edwin C. Howell is an enigmatic figure in the history of mathematics.
The rotations named after him are designs for the scheduling of Bridge
tournaments.

In a duplicate bridge tournament players compete in partnerships, two
partnerships at a table. At the beginning of a round each table is given
one from a certain number of duplicate boards each of which contains a
pack of cards dealt evenly into four pockets. The boards are labelled
north-south-east-west, and are aligned on the table so that one
partnership plays north-south and the other east-west. After the game is
finished the cards are returned to the pockets as they were dealt and
the duplicate board is returned, to be used again in subsequent
matches.

If one partnership plays directly against another at the same table, the
two partnerships are said to *oppose* each other. If two partnerships
play in the same direction on the same board in different rounds, they
are said to *compete*.

In scoring, not only is the performance of teams in opposition
considered, but also the performance of partnerships which compete.

A good tournament design would have the properties that each partnership
opposed each other partnership at the same table exactly once and also
that each partnership competed against each other partnership at the
same number of times.

A ****complete balanced Howell rotation [$CBHR(n)$]****[^10] is an array
(based on $n$ elements) of side $s$, where $s=n$ for $n$ odd, and
$s=n-1$ for $n$ even, which satisfies the following properties:

1.  Each of the $s^2$ cells is empty or contains an ordered pair of
    distinct elements.

2.  Each of the $n$ elements appears exactly once in each row and each
    column. (If $n$ is odd, then one row and one column is excepted)

3.  Each unordered pair of distinct elements occurs in exactly one cell
    of the array.

4.  Each pair of distinct elements appears together in a block[^11]
    exactly $\left \lfloor{n/2}\right \rfloor -1$ times, where
    $\left \lfloor{x}\right \rfloor $ means the integral part of $x$.

To interpret a CBHR as a duplicate bridge tournament schedule, we
represent the partnerships by elements, the boards ny rows and the
rounds of the tournament by columns.

Then an ordered pair $(x,y)$ in position $(i,j)$ of the array
corresponds to partnership $x$ opposing partnership $y$ on board $i$ in
round $j$. We adopt the convention that $x$ plays NS, $y$ EW. The third
property in the definition of a CBHR ensures that all partnerships are
in opposition exactly once, while the fourth (with blocks of the
associated BIBD representing partnerships in competition) ensures that
each partnership competes against each other partnership the same number
of times.

Notice that when $n$ is even the definition of a CBHR is precisely that
of a balanced Room square. So the BRS above is also a $CBHR(8)$. The
reason for maintaining both definitions is that a CBHR is, according to
conditions 2 and 4, allowed to have odd order. Also, an important
construction for $BRS(4n)$, which will be introduced, involves two
$CBHR(2n-1)$s.

Unlike Room squares the question of the existence of balanced Room
squares is far from resolved, but various proofs have shown there to be
many infinite classes of these designs. The details of some of these
proofs are given below.

Interestingly the existence problem for balanced Room squares (then
known exclusively as CBHR) was brought to the attention of
mathematicians, in 1955 by Parker and Mood, the very same year as T.G.
Room published his original article. Either this problem has proved to
be very much more difficult, or has aroused significantly less interest.
The first general result, that of Hwang (1970), coming only a few years
before the corresponding problem for Room squares was settled (1973).

In order to discuss these results the first step is to make the
necessary adaptation of the starter-adder approach.

Starters and Adders for BRS and CBHR
------------------------------------

In deriving the definitions of a starter and adder for a Room square,
the terminology of difference systems was introduced. We saw that a
requirement of the starter was that each non-zero member of the relevant
Galois field occurred exactly once as a difference between the members
of some pair. This was so that each pair occurred exactly once in the
Room square\
\
BIBDs can be constructed from difference systems in much the same way,
but with the difference that each element in the BIBD occurs occurs with
each other element $\lambda$ times, not necessarily just once.\
\
*Example*\
A BIBD on $GF(7)$ can be constructed from the sets
$\{6,5,3\}\{2,4,1\}$.\
\
$\{0,6,4\},\{1,0,5\},\{2,1,6\},\{3,2,0\},\{4,3,1\},\{5,4,2\}$ are the
blocks obtained from the left hand set.\
$\{3,5,2\},\{4,6,3\},\{5,0,4\},\{6,1,5\},\{0,2,6\},\{1,3,0\}$ are the
blocks obtained from the right hand set.\
\
Because the two sets are both triples, under cyclic construction the
block design obtained will necessarily have $k=r=3$.\
\
The left hand set has each non-zero member of $GF(7)$ occurring exactly
once as a difference between its members. So, taken with its translates
(those blocks obtained from it under cyclic development), this set
should form a BIBD with $r=3$ and $\lambda=1$. Similarly the right hand
block forms a BIBD with $r=3$ and $\lambda=1$, and the two sets taken
together as difference system therefore generate a BIBD with $r=6$ and
$\lambda =2$.\
\
If we add the ideal element $\infty$ to the left hand set and all its
translates, and 0 to the right hand set (developing it cyclically along
with the other members) then we obtain a new BIBD with $r=7$ and
$\lambda = 3$, whose blocks are:
$$\{\infty,6,5,3\},\{\infty,0,6,4\},\{\infty,1,0,5\},\{\infty,2,1,6\},\{\infty,3,2,0\},\{\infty,4,3,1\},\{\infty,5,4,2\}$$
$$\{0,2,4,1\},\{1,3,5,2\},\{2,4,6,3\},\{3,5,0,4\},\{4,6,1,5\},\{5,0,2,6\},\{6,1,3,0\}$$
Which is precisely the BIBD obtained from the Room square at the
beginning of this chapter. If the block design associated with a BRS, or
a CBHR, is obtained by taking the left hand member of the pairs in the
first row as one block and the left hand members in subsequent rows as
the translates, and all right members of pairs as the remaining blocks
of a BIBD, then clearly those two blocks, the left hand and the right
hand, which belong to the starter must form a difference system.\
\
The set of pairs $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),...,(x_{n-1},y_{n-1})$ is a
***balanced starter*** in $G=GF(2n-1)$ if

1.  the unordered pairs $\{x_i,y_i\}$ form a starter in $G$, and

2.  the blocks $\{x_1,x_2,...,x_{n-1}\}$ and $\{y_1,y_2,...,y_{n-1}\}$
    form a difference system.

A balanced starter is ***strong*** if
$x_1+y_1,x_2+y_2,...,x_{n-1}+y_{n-1}$ are all distinct mod$(2n-1)$.

#### Theorem 5.3.1

Given a strong balanced starter on $G=GF(2n-1)$, then a $CBHR(2n-1)$
exists.\
*Proof*\
Assign the pair $(x_i+g,y_i+g)$ to cell $(g,x_i+y_i+g)$ for all
$g \in G$. Condition (i) along with the strong-ness of the starter
ensures that every $g \in G$ occurs in every row and column exactly once
except $g$ does not occur in row or column $g$ for all $g \in G$ [due to
the absence in cell (0,0) of the pair $\{\infty,0\}$]. Condition (i)
also ensures that each unordered pair of $G$ occurs exactly once in the
array, replace the unordered pairs with ordered pairs.\
That the block design obtained is balanced follows from condition (ii).\
Notice that each of the 2 blocks generates $(n-1)(n-2)$ differences and
these represent each of $2n-2$ members of $G \backslash \{0\}$,
$\lambda$ times. Therefore $2(n-1)(n-2) = \lambda (2n-2),$
$ \Rightarrow \lambda = n-2$.

#### Theorem 5.3.2

Given a strong balanced starter on $G=GF(2n-1)$, then a $BRS(2n)$
exists.\
*Proof*\
Assign the pair $(x_i+g,y_i+g)$ to cell $(g,x_i+y_i+g)$ for all
$g \in G$, and (provided $n$ is even), also assign the pair $(\infty,g)$
to cell $(g,g)$ for all $g \in G$.\
Again, condition (i) and the strong-ness of the starter ensure that an
ORS based on $G \cup \{\infty\}$ is obtained. The block design
associated with this array has initial blocks,
$$\{\infty\} \cup \{x_1,x_2,...,x_{n-1}\}$$
$$\{0\} \cup \{y_1,y_2,...,y_{n-1}\}$$ Adjoining 0 to
$\{y_1,y_2,...,y_{n-1}\}$ creates each non-zero member of $G$ as a
difference once more, either as $y_i-0$ or $0-y_i$.\
Adjoining $\infty$ to $\{x_1,x_2,..,x_{n-1}\}$ creates $n-1$ pairs
involving $\infty$ in this block, hence $\infty$ makes a pair with each
member of $G$ $n-1$ times.\
So the design is balanced with a concurrence number of $n-1$.\
\
It is a simple matter to derive the remaining parameters of the BIBD
associated with either array.

                         $v$        $b$        $r$       $k$    $\lambda$

   $CBHR(2n)/BRS(2n)$    $2n$    $2(2n-1)$   $2n-1)$     $n$      $n-1$

**Table 7 BIBD parameters for BRS and CBHR**

The block design of a balanced Room square is *self-complementary*. This
means that if a block $D$ belongs to the design, then its complement
$\overline{D}$ also appears. If the left hand pairs in row $x$ form one
block then the right hand pairs in the same row are also a block, and
the two blocks are complementary. Alternatively we can say that, in a
self-complementary BIBD, the complementary design (obtained by replacing
all blocks with their complements) is identical to the design itself.\
Schellenberg proved an interesting result regarding self-complementary
BIBDs.

#### Theorem 5.3.3

[21] In a self-complementary BIBD with parameters of the form,\
$(2n,2(2n-1)t,(2n-1)t,n,(n-1)t)$, every triple of elements is contained
in $t(n-2)/2$ blocks.\
\
*Proof*\
Suppose $B$ is a self-complementary BIBD with parameters of the form
above, based on a set of elements $V$. Denote by $S_{i...j}$ the set of
blocks which contain $u$ but not $v$ or $w$. Because the design is
self-complementary to each block of this set there corresponds a unique
block which contains $v$ and $w$ but not $u$. The set of these blocks is
$S_{vw}-S_u$ and clearly: $$|S_u - \{S_v \cup S_w\}| = |S_{vw} - S_u|$$
Now,\
$|S_u-\{S_v \cup S_w\}| = |S_u| - |S_{uv}| -|S_{uw}| + |S_{uvw}|$ and,\
$|S_{vw} - S_u| = |S_{vw}| - |S_{uvw}|$
$$\therefore |S_u| - |S_{uv}| -|S_{uw}| + |S_{uvw}| = |S_{vw}| - |S_{uvw}|$$
$$2|S_{uvw}| = |S_{vw}| + |S_{uv}| + |S_{uw}| - |S_{U}|$$ Because $B$ is
a $BIBD$, each pair of elements occur together in $\lambda = (n-1)t$
blocks and each element occurs in $r=(2n-1)t$ blocks. So,
$$|S_{vw}| = |S_{uv}| = |S_{uw}| = (n-1)t$$ and $$|S_u| = (2n-1)t$$
Therefore, $$2|S_{uvw}|=3(n-1)t-(2n-1)t=(n-2)t$$ and so,
$$|S_{uvw}| = \frac{(n-2)t}{2}$$ Since $u$, $v$ and $w$ are arbitrary
this implies that each triple occurs in $(n-2)t/2$ blocks. $\square$\
\
The implication of this result for balanced Room squares is that,
because $t=1$ for a $BRS$[^12] and we require the LHS of this expression
to be an integer, $n$ is necessarily even. So writing $n=2m$, we know
the order of a $BRS$ is always of the form $4m$.

#### Corollary 5.3.1

A $BRS(n)$ can only exist for $n \equiv 0$ mod 4.\
\
We now present Hwangâ€™s starter-adder construction for balanced Room
squares.

#### Theorem 5.3.4

[14] There exists a $BRS$ of order $q+1$, where $q=p^r \equiv $ 3(mod 4)
is a prime power strictly greater than 3.\
\
*Proof*\
We show that the pairs
$$X = \left \{(x^{2i+1},x^{2i}): 0 \leq i \leq \frac{q-3}{2} \right \}$$
form a balanced starter, where $x$ is a primitive element in $GF(q)$,
and the set
$$A(X) = \left \{-x^{2i}(1+x): 0 \leq i \leq \frac{q-3}{2} \right \}$$
is a corresponding adder.\
Looking back at Theorem 2.4(?), we have already shown that the unordered
pairs
$$\left \{\{x^{2i},x^{2i+1}\}: 0 \leq i \leq \frac{q-3}{2} \right \}$$
are those of a starter with adder $A(X)$. So it remains to show that the
starter is balanced which involves proving that the two blocks
$$B_1 = \{0,x,x^3,...,x^{q-2}\} \hspace{0.5cm} \mathrm{and} \hspace{0.5cm} B_2 = \{\infty,x^0,x^2,...,x^{q-3}\}$$
generate a $BIBD$. This result is due to R.C. Bose and makes use of the
properties of the squares and non-squares of $GF(q)$ where $q$ is an odd
prime.\
Let $R$ and $N$ denote the sets of non-zero square and non-squares in
$GF(q)$, respectively. $$R=\{x^2,x^4,...,x^{q-1}\}$$
$$N=\{x^1,x^3,...,x^{q-2}\}$$ These sets both contain precisely
$\frac{1}{2}(q-1)$ elements.\
So, $$B_1 = \{0\} \cup N,$$ and because $x^{q-1} = 1 = x^0$,\
$$B_2 = \{\infty\} \cup R$$ Also, if $a$ is square then $-a$ is a
non-square[^13], which implies that $R=-N$.\
\
To show that the blocks with their translates form a $BIBD$ it is
necessary to show that the differences between members of $B_1$ and $R$
generate all the non-zero members of $GF(q)$ some number of times, then
by adjoining the element $\infty$ to $R$ and its translates will
generate a $BIBD$.\
Firstly, suppose that 1, which belongs to $R$, can be expressed as a
difference between members of $R$ in a certain number of different ways,
$$1 = x^{2a_1}-x^{2b_1}=...x^{2a_r}-x^{2b_r}$$ Were this true, any
member of $R$ could be written as a difference in the same number of
ways.\
Multiply through by any $x^{2s} \in R$.
$$x^{2s} = x^{2(a_1+s)}-x^{2(b_1+s)}=...=x^{2(a_r+s)}-x^{2(b_r+s)}$$ But
now suppose that any element of $R$ can be expressed as a difference
between members of $R$ in a certain number of ways, i.e. assume this
second expression holds. Then by dividing through by $x^{2s}$, we
recover the first expression and hence for each representation of 1
there is a corresponding representation of $x^{2s}$, and vice versa. So
there are an equal number of representations of every member of $R$ as a
difference of members of $R$. The remaining non-zero members of $GF(q)$,
are all those $q \notin R$ where $-q \in R$, but each representation of
$-r$ gives a corresponding representation of $r$: $$-r=x^{2a}-x^{2b}$$
$$r = x^{2b} - x^{2a}$$ So every element of $-r$ has the same number of
representations as a difference between members of $R$ as $R$ does.\
\
We know that $R$ has $\frac{1}{2}(q-1)$ elements, therefore there are\
$\frac{1}{2}(q-1) \cdot \frac{1}{2} (q-3) = \frac{1}{4}(q-1)(q-3)$
differences between those elements, and if each of these differences
generates each of the $q-1$ non-zero members of $GF(q)$, $\lambda$ times
then: $$\lambda(q-1)=\frac{1}{4}(q-1)(q-3)$$
$$\lambda=\frac{1}{4}(q-3)$$ Also, because $N=-R$, we can say that all
the non-zero members of $GF(q)$ arise as differences between members of
$N$. Further, $B_1$ also gives the differences
$0-n,n-0 \hspace{0.5cm} n\in N$, which are all the non-zero members of
$GF(q)$, once again. So in total every non-zero member of $GF(q)$ occurs
as a difference between elements of $B_1$ and $R$,
$2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} (q-3) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} (q-1)$ times.\
Because $R$ and its translates each contain $ \frac{1}{2}(q-1)$
elements, each member of $GF(q)$ occurs $ \frac{1}{2}(q-1)$ times in all
those blocks. Therefore, adjoining $\infty$ to each block generates
blocks of size $ \frac{1}{2}(q-1)$, with $\infty$ making a pair with
each member of $GF(q)$, $ \frac{1}{2}(q-1)$ times.\
So we can say that $B_1$, $B_2$ and their translates for a
$BIBD(q+1,\frac{1}{2}(q+1), \frac{1}{2}(q-1))$.\
Therefore Hwangâ€™s starter is balanced. $\square$\
\
The $BRS$ in Figure 27 was obtained from Hwangâ€™s starter, hence its
block design was a $BIBD$.\
\
*Example 5.3.1*\
A balanced starter in $GF(19)$ is:
$$X = \{(2,1),(8,4),(13,16),(14,7),(18,9),(15,17),(3,11),(12,6),(10,5)\}$$
Which has a corresponding adder: $$A(X) = \{16,7,9,17,11,6,5,1,4\}$$ So
the following row is an appropriate choice for a $BRS(20)$:

   $\infty,0$   -   14,7   2,1   15,7   -   -   -   18,9   -   13,16   -   8,4   -   3,11   10,5   -   -   12,6

A Multiplicative Construction for BRS
-------------------------------------

Although the Hwang starter-adder construction establishes the existence
of an infinite class of $BRS$, like Mullin & Nemethâ€™s construction for
Room squares, exceptions still remain.\
\
Particularly all those $BRS$ of order $q+1$ where q is not a prime
power, yet is congruent 3 modulo 4. For example, the existence of
$BRS(16)$ is not established yet, because 15 is not a prime power. One
approach to resolving this problem would be to establish a
multiplication theorem like those established for Room squares. The
following doubling construction for $BRS$ (due to Schellenberg), for
example, enables to construction of a $BRS(16)$ from two $BRS(8)$.\
\
Significantly, used along with Hwangâ€™s starter-adder construction, it
establishes the existence of another infinite class of $BRS$, those of
order $2(q+1)$, where $q$ is subject to the conditions of Theorem 3.5.\
\
Before presenting the doubling construction a few definitions need to be
made, and another result regarding self-complementary block designs
established.\
\
The ***reduced*** Room square $\hat{R}$, is obtained by taking a
standardised Room square $R$ and removing the pairs involving $\infty$,
i.e. the diagonal pairs.\
\
Two $ORS$, $R$ and $S$ (both of side $a$) are said to be a ***Latin
pair*** if on forming the join of $\hat{R}$ and $\hat{S}$, and placing
the pair $(i,i)$ in cell $(i,i)$ for $0 \leq i \leq q-1$ the join of two
$MOLS$ is obtained, denoted by $R \odot S$.\
\
A ***common traversal*** of $R \odot S$ is a set of $q$ cells, one from
each row and each column, whose $n$ ordered pairs have $n$ distinct
first elements and $n$ distinct second elements.\
\
Suppose we have a set of varieties $V = \{1,2,3,...\}$, then by a set
$V'$, we mean $V'=\{1',2',3',...\}$.

#### Lemma 5.4.1

[21] If
$$\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{2k-1} \left \{C_i,\bar{C_i} \right \} \hspace{0.5cm} \mathrm{and} \hspace{0.5cm} 
\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{2k-1} \left \{D_i,\bar{D_i} \right \}$$ are the
blocks of two self-complementary $BIBD$s, both defined on a set of
elements $V$, where $\bar{C}$ denotes the complement of $C$, with
parameters $(2k,2(2k-1),2k-1,k,k-1)$ then.
$$\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{2k-1} \left \{C_i \cup D'_i, \bar{C_i} \cup \bar{D'_i}, C_i \cup \bar{D'_i},
\bar{C_i} \cup D'_i  \right \} \cup \{V,V'\}$$ is the set of blocks of a
self-complementary $BIBD$, defined on the set of elements $V \cup V'$,
with parameters $(4k,2(4k-1),4k-1,2k,2k-1)$.\
\
*Proof*\
Consider an arbitrary pair $\{a,b\}$ in the new $BIBD$ where
$a,b \in V$. The concurrence number of the original $BIBD$ was $k-1$, so
this pair occurred $k-1$ times in the blocks
$\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{2k-1} \left \{C_i,\bar{C_i} \right \}$, but these
blocks clearly appear twice each in the new $BIBD$. Also the pair
$\{a,b\}$ occurs once in the block $V$, so the pair $\{a,b\}$ occurs
$2(k-1)+1 = 2k-1$ times. The same would be true for any pair $\{a,b\}$
when $a,b \in V'$.\
\
Now consider an arbitrary pair $\{a,b\}$ when $a \in V$, and $b \in V'$.
From the definition of complementary blocks $a$ occurs either $C$ or
$\bar{C}$ and $b$ in either $D'$ or $\bar{D'}$, for some value of $i$,
and because all pair combinations between $C$-blocks and $D'$-blocks are
formed in the new design and because $i$ takes $2k-1$ values in the new
design so the pair makes $2k-1$ appearances.\
\
Hence the new block design is a $BIBD$ with $\lambda =2k-1$. $\square$

#### Theorem 5.4.1

Suppose we have two $BRS(q+1)$, $R$ and $S$ based on $G = GF(q)$, with
the following properties:

1.  $R$ and $S$ are a *Latin pair* such that,

2.  $R \odot S$ has a pair of disjoint *common transversals* $T_1$ and
    $T_2$ (with $T_2$ in $R$), which do not intersect the main diagonal,
    and

3.  the block designs obtained from $R$ and $S$, call them $D(R)$ and
    $D(S)$ respectively, have the property that if $\{\infty\} \cup B_i$
    and $\{i\} \cup C_i$ are the blocks of $D(R)$ obtained from row $i$,
    then $\{i\} \cup B_i$ and $\{\infty\} \cup C_i$ are the blocks of
    $D(S)$ obtained from row $i$.

Then a $BRS(2(q+1))$ exists.\
\
*Proof*\
Define $A$ to be the array obtained from the superposition of $\hat{R}$
and $\hat{S'}$. Where $\hat{S'}$ is obtained by replacing the elements
of $G$ in $\hat{S}$ (the reduced RS) by the corresponding elements of
$G'$ and replacing $\infty$ by $\infty'$. $R$ and $S$ were $BRS$ so each
column and row of $A$ contains each member of
$G \cup G' \cup \{\infty,\infty'\}$, except those elements $i,i',\infty$
and $\infty'$ which are missing from row and column $i$ due to the
reduction process. Further, $A$ contains every pair
$\{i,j\},\{i',j'\} \hspace{0.25cm} i,j \in G,i \neq j$ exactly once.\
Define $B$ as the array obtained from $R \odot S$ when each pair $(i,j)$
is replaced by $(i,j')$.\
\
Now, $D$ is defined as the array obtained from $B$ according to this
procedure:\
If cell $(m,n), m\neq n$ of $R$ is not empty, replace $(i,j')$ in cell
$(m,n)$ of $B$ by $(j',i)$. Because $R \odot S$ is a pair of superposed
orthogonal latin squares $D$ contains each member of $G \cup G'$ exactly
once in each row and column. Also, the way in which we have repalced
elements ensures that every unordered pair $\{i,j'\}$ for all
$i,j \in G$ occurs exactly once in $D$.\
\
Next, construct $C$ by arranging the arrays $A$ and $D$ according to the
following layout, in which $\phi$ is the $q \times q$ array with every
cell empty, $\theta$ the $1 \times q$ array of empty cells and
$\theta ^T$ the transpose of $\theta$:

$C=$

     $A$       $\phi$      $\theta ^T$
  ---------- ---------- ------------------
    $\phi$      $D$        $\theta ^T$
   $\theta$   $\theta$   $\infty',\infty$

The rows and columns of this new array are labelled
$0,1,2,...,q-1,0',1',2',...,(q-1)',l$. So that the pair
$(\infty ', \infty)$ is in cell $(l,l)$.\
\
Let

$T'_p = \{ (i'_m,j'_m) | (i_m,j_m)$ *is a cell transversal* $T_p \}$

be the set of cells of $C$, corresponding to transversal
$T_p \hspace{0.25cm}(p=1,2)$ of $R \odot S$.\
\
Construct a new array $F$, based on $C$ according to the following
prescription:\
\
Consider cell $(i'_m,j'_m) \in T'_1$. If cell $(i_m,j_m)$ is not empty
in $R$ then $(i'_m,j'_m)$ of $C$ contains a pair $(k',n)$, otherwise it
contains a pair $(n,k')$. [In either case
$k,nm \in G \hspace{0.25cm} k \neq n$ (the transversal does not
intersect the diagonal)]. Remove whichever pair appears in cell
$(i'_m,j'_m)$ and put it in cell $(i'_m,l)$. Also place $(\infty',k')$,
$(\infty,n)$ in cells $(k,j'_m),(n,j'_m)$ respectively.\
If $(i'_m,j'_m) \in T'_2$ then a pair $(k',n)$ appears in cell
$(i'_m,j'_m)$. Again remove it, but this time put it in $(l,j'_m)$. In
addition pairs $(k',\infty),(\infty ',n)$ go in cells
$(i'_m,k),(i'_m,n)$ respectively.\
\
$F$ is a $BRS$ because,

-   $A$ and $D$ between them intially contain all the unordered pairs
    $\{i,j\},\{i',j'\}$ $i,j \in G, i\neq j$ and $\{i,j'\}$ for all
    $i,j \in G$. So $F$ has an ordered pair corresponding to each of
    these.

-   The procedure in the preceding paragraph contributes the remaining
    ordered pairs\
    $(\infty ',k'),(\infty,n),(k',\infty),(\infty ',n)$ for all
    $k,n \in G \hspace{0.25cm} k \neq n$ in such a way that the elements
    missing from the first $q$ rows and columns are suitably placed, and
    $\infty$ and $\infty '$ are placed in each row and column of $F$.
    Hence each row and column of $F$ contains every member of
    $\{\infty, \infty '\} \cup G \cup G'$ exactly once.

The block design obtained from the rows of $F$ has blocks:

$
\left.
\begin{tabular}{c}
${} B~i~ {â€™} Câ€™~i~$\\
${i} C~i~ {iâ€™} Bâ€™~i~$\\
\end{tabular}
\right \}
0 \leq i \leq q-1
$

from rows 0,1,...,$q-1$ blocks

$
\left.
\begin{tabular}{c}
${} B~i~ {iâ€™} Bâ€™~i~$\\
${i} C~i~ {} Câ€™~i~$\\
\end{tabular}
\right \}
0 \leq i \leq q-1
$

from rows $0',1',...,(q-1)'$, and the blocks
$$\{\infty\} \cup F, \{\infty '\} \cup G'$$ obtained from row $l$.\
According to condition 3 of Theorem 3.6 and Lemma 3.1, these blocks for
a $BIBD$. $\square$\

Finally we construct $F$ according to the 2 presciptions in the final
part of the construction. Which involves first replacing some of the
pairs in those cells of $C$ corresponding to $D$.\
Consider
$$T'_1 = \{(2',6'),(3',0'),(4',1'),(5',2'),(6',3'),(0',4'),(1',5')\}$$
In $R$, the cells $(2,6),(3,0),(4,1),(5,2),(6,3),(0,4)$ and $(1,5)$ were
all non-empty, so $C$ contains pairs of the form $(k',n)$ in all cells
$(2',6'),(3',0')$, ... All of these are removed and replaced in the
final column of the same row. And, for each pair $(k',n)$, corresponding
pairs of the form $(\infty ', k'), (\infty,n)$ are put in cells
$(k,j'_m),(n,j'_m)$, respectively.\
e.g.\
$(5',3)$ appears in position $(2',6')$ of $C$. So in $F$, $(5',3)$
appears in $(2',l)$ and the additional pairs $(\infty,3)$ and
$(\infty ',5')$ appear in column $6'$, in rows 3 and 5 respectively.\
\
All of which makes the final columns appear like so:

               $0'$            $1'$            $2'$            $3'$             $4'$             $5'$             $6'$               $l$

Now consider:
$$T'_2 = \{(4',5'),(5',6'),(6',0'),(0',1'),(1',2'),(2',3'),(3',4')\}$$
In each cell $(i'_m,j'_m)$ of $C$, where $(i'_m,j'_m) \in T'_2$, occurs
a pair $(k',n)$, we remove this and place it in cell $(l,j'_m)$, also
putting pairs $(k',\infty),(\infty ',n)$ in cells $(i'_m,k),(i'_m,n)$.\
e.g.\
$(3',6)$ appears in $(4',5')$, so $(3',6)$ goes in $(l,5')$ and
$(3',\infty), (\infty ', 6)$ go in $(4',3),(4',6)$ respectively.

Schellenberg applied his multiplicative construction to the $BRS$
generated by Hwangâ€™s starter-adder construction, and in doing so was
able to establish the following Theorem:

#### Theorem 5.4.2

[21] For $q \equiv 3$(mod 4), with $q$ a prime power strictly greater
than 3, there exists a $BRS(2(q+1))$.\
\
*Proof*\
Construct $R$ from the following balanced starter,
$$X = \left \{ (x^{2i},x^{2i+1}):0 \leq i \leq \frac{q-3}{2} \right \}$$
with adder,
$$A(X) = \left \{ -x^{2i}(1+x):0 \leq i \leq \frac{q-3}{2} \right \}$$
Clearly this is just the Hwang starter-adder of Theorem 5.3.4, although
the elements in the starter pairs have swapped order. Now, construct $S$
from the balanced starter,
$$Y = \left \{ (x^{2i-1},x^{2i}):0 \leq i \leq \frac{q-3}{2} \right \}$$
$$A(Y) = \left \{ -x^{2i-1}(1+x):0 \leq i \leq \frac{q-3}{2} \right \}$$
$Y$ has been obtained simply by swapping the pairs of $X$ and
multiplying them by $x^{-1}$. Therefore, that $Y$ is a balanced starter
follows from the fact that $X$ is balanced, as was established in
Theorem 3.5.\
It remains to show that $R$ and $S$ satisfy conditions 1,2 and 3 of
Theorem 3.6:

1.  $R$ and $S$ are a Latin pair: The positions of the starter pais in
    the first row of each square are determined by the adder, so
    $A(X) \cap A(Y) = \varnothing$[^14] ensures that each cell of the
    first row, hence subsequent rows, of $R \odot S$ contains only one
    pair.\
    \
    That $R \odot S$ is a pair of superposed Latin squares requires that
    for the pairs in any row, the left hand members take all values
    0...$q-1$, and the right members also take values 0...$q-1$.\
    Clearly this property holds for all rows if it holds for the first.
    The pairs in the first row of $R \odot S$ are:
    $$\{(0,0)\} \cup \left \{ (x^{2i-1},x^{2i}),(x^{2i},x^{2i+1}) \middle| 0 \leq i \leq \frac{q-3}{2} \right \}$$
    So all $(q-1)/2$ non-squares and all $(q-1)/2$ squares occur as left
    hand members of pairs, and similarly as right hand members. So
    $R \odot S$ is a pair of superposed Latin squares.\
    For these Latin squares to be orthogonal requires that there is no
    repetition of ordered pairs. For a repetition to occur would require
    some repetition of ordered differences among the starter pairs.\
    Either:
    $$x^{2i-1} - x^{2i} = x^{2i} - x^{2i+1} \hspace{0.2cm} \mathrm{or} \hspace{0.2cm}
    x^{2i} - x^{2i-1} = x^{2i+1} - x^{2i} \hspace{0.2cm} \mathrm{i.e.}$$
    $$\pm (x^{2i-1} + x^{2i+1}) = \pm (x^{2i} + x^{2i})$$
    $$x^{-1} + x = 2 \Rightarrow x = 1$$ Clearly false, so ordered
    differences are unique.

2.  $R \odot S$ has a pair of disjoint *common transversals*:\
    For any fixed non-zero $j$ the cells $(i,i+j)$, $0 \leq i \leq q-1$
    form a common transversal which does not intersect the diagonal.

3.  The block designs for $R$ and $S$ are balanced:\
    The starters $X$ and $Y$ are balanced starters hence the block
    designs for $R$ and $S$ are $BIBD$s. $\square$

So the Schellenberg multiplication construction establishes the
existence of some new orders $q+1$ where $q$ is not necessarily a prime
power.\
e.g.\
the orders in bold are now established which had not been under Hwangâ€™s
construction:

<span>|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|</span>

  --------------------------------
            Hwang $BRS$
   $p^r + 1: p^r \equiv 3$(mod 4)
  --------------------------------

& 8 & 12 & & 20 & 24 & 28 & 32 & & & 44 & 48 & ...\

  --------------
   Schellenberg
   $2(p^r + 1)$
  --------------

& **16** & 24 & 32 & **40** & 48 & **56** & **64** & 72 & 80 & **88** &
**96** & ...\

**Table 8**

Even with both these theorems, there are obviously missing orders. The
first exception, 36 occurs, for example, because 35 is not a prime power
and because 17 is not congruent to 3 mod 4.\
\
Schellenberg applied the multiplicative construction to the case when
$p^r \equiv 1$(mod 4) [then, of course, $2(p^r+1) \equiv 0$(mod 4) as is
required] and was able to obtain further results. Although, as an
interesting parallel to the Mullin-Nemeth construction, he also had
problems with the Fermat primes and again they were treated separately.
Rather than look at his approach we consider the later approach by Du,
Yu, Hwang and Kang amongst others.

Symmetric Skew Balanced Starters
--------------------------------

If $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2), ...,(x_{(q-1)/2},y_{(q-1)/2})$ are the pairs of
a balanced starter in $GF(q)$ then we say that starter is ***skew*** if
$\pm(x_1+y_1), \pm(x_2+y_2), ..., \pm(x_{(q-1)/2},y_{(q-1)/2})$ are all
distinct mod $q$.\
Notice that a skew starter is necessarily a strong starter (all sums are
distinct).\
A balanced starter is ***symmetric*** if
$\{x_1,x_2,...,x_{(q-1)/2}\}=\{-x_1,-x_2,...,x_{(q-1)/2}\}$\
\
In [13] it was claimed that Schellenbergâ€™s multiplication theorem could
be applied to two $CBHR(2n-1)$s, both obtained from $SSBS$, to construct
a $BRS(4n)$. It was then shown that $SSBS$ exist for all prime powers
$2n-1=8k+5>5$, and so the existence of $BRS(4n)$ for these values was
believed to be established.

Recently, Anderson[2], has noticed a flaw in this approach and corrected
it.\
Suppose we wished to apply Schellenbergâ€™s construction to two
$CBHR(2n-1)$s, call them $P$ and $Q$, then it would be necessary to make
a slight alteration to Theorem 3.6 to accomodate the missing diagonal
pairs, i.e. $\{\infty,i\}$ from row $i$.\
\
**Theorem 5.5.1** Suppose we have two $CBHR(2n-1)$, $P$ and $Q$ based on
$G=GF(2n-1)$, with the following properties:

1.  $P$ and $Q$ are a *Latin pair* such that,

2.  $P \odot Q$ has a pair of disjoint *common transversals* $T_1$ and
    $T_2$ (with $T_2$ in $P$), which do not intersect that main
    diagonal, and

3.  the block designs obtained from $P$ and $Q$, call them $D(P)$ and
    $D(Q)$ respectively, have the property that if $B_i$ and $C_i$ are
    the blocks from $D(P)$ obtained from row $i$, then $B_i$ and $C_i$
    are also the blocks of $D(Q)$ obtained from row $i$.

Then a $BRS(4n)$ exists.\
\
*Proof*\
As for Theorem 3.6\
 It was then claimed that the two $CBHR(2n-1)$s obtained from a $SSBS$
and its transpose satisfy the three conditions of Theorem 3.8. Hence
implying the existence of a $BRS(4n)$.\
However, recently a counter-example has been found.

#### Lemma 5.5.1

[2] If $p=8k+5$ is a prime, $p > 5$, then the pairs
$$(x^{4i},-x{4i+1}),(x^{4i+2},x^{4i+1})\hspace{0.5cm} 0 \leq i \leq 2k$$
form a $SSBS$ in $GF(p)$, provided $x^2-1$ is a square mod $p$.\
\
*Proof*

1.  The elements in the starter pairs are a complete replication of
    $GF(p) \backslash \{0\}$.\
    $x^{\frac{1}{2} (q-1)} = x^{4k+2} = -1$, therefore we can write the
    pairs as,
    $$(X^{4i},x^{4(k+i)+3}),(x^{4i+2},x^{4i+1}) \hspace{0.5cm} 0 \leq i \leq 2k$$
    All the members of these pairs are clearly unique and there are
    $4(2k+1)=8k+4$ of them, hence they must all of
    $(GF(p) \backslash \{0\}$.

2.  The differences are similarly a complete replication of
    $GF(p)  \backslash \{0\}$.\
    The differences are $\pm x^{4i}(x+1), \pm x^{4i+1}(x-1)$, which can
    be written as
    $$x^{4i}(x+1), x^{4(i+k)+2}(x+1),x^{4i+1}(x-1),x^{4(i+k)+3}(x-1)$$
    Which are all unique provided $(x+1)$ and $(x-1)$ have the same
    quadratic character (meaning either both of neither are squares).
    This is true because $(x+1)(1-x) = x^2-1$ is a square.

3.  The starter is ***skew***, (the positive and negative sums are all
    distinct).\
    The sums are $\pm x^{4i}(1-x), \pm x^{4i+1}(x+1)$ which again are
    all unique, provided $(1-x)$ and $(x+1)$ have the same quadratic
    character. True, because $(1-x)(x+1) = -(x^2-1) = x^{4k+2}(x^2-1)$,
    is a square.

4.  The starter is ***symmetric***.\
    Indeed, $-x^{4i} = x^{4(i+k)+2}$, generates the same elements as
    $x^{4i+2}$ shifted by $k$ places.

5.  The associated block design is balanced.\
    The blocks in the first row are,\
    $\{\infty\} \cup R$, due to the left hand members (where $R$ is the
    set of squares).\
    $\{0\} \cup N$, due to the right hand members (where $N$ is the set
    of non-squares).\
    We can show that these blocks along with their translates form a
    $BIBD$.\
    \
    Using an argument from Theorem 5.2.4, we can say that all elements
    of $R$ are generated as differences of $R$ from the same number of
    times (say $\lambda _1$ times). Also, a similar argument allows us
    to say that all the elements of $N$ are generated as differences of
    $R$ the same number of times (say $\lambda _2$). Now, of course
    $N = xR$. So we can say that to each difference of members of $R$
    which generates a square there is a difference of $N$ which
    generates a non-square. Therefore every $r \in R$ occurs as a
    difference in $N, \lambda _1$ times. For the same reason every
    $n \in N$ occurs as a difference between members of $N, \lambda _2$
    times. Therefore, each element of $GF(p) \backslash \{0\}$ occurs
    $\lambda _1 + \lambda _2$ times as a difference in $R$ or $N$.\
    \
    Now, $|R| = |N| = 4k+2$. So each of the two sets, $R$ and $N$, gives
    $(4k+2)(4k+1)$ differences. Furthermore there are $8k+4$ elements of
    $GF(p) \backslash \{0\}$, and each occurs as a difference
    $\lambda _1 + \lambda _2$ times. So,
    $$(2(4k+2)(4k+1) = (\lambda _1 + \lambda _2)(8k+4)$$
    $$\therefore \lambda _1 + \lambda _2 = 4k+1$$ Adjoining 0 to $N$
    creates each member of $GF(p) \backslash \{0\}$ once again, as
    either $0-n$ or $n-0$.\
    Adjoining $\infty$ to $R$, makes $|R| = 4k+2$ pairs involving
    $\infty$. Therefore, $\{\infty\} \cup R$ and $\{0\} \cup N$ and
    their translates have between them each pair from
    $\{\infty\{ \cup GF(p)$ occurring $4k+2$ times. Hence the block
    design is balanced.

*Example 5.5.1*\
Let $P$ be the $CBHR(2n-1)$ obtained from the $SSBS$ in Lemma 3.2 when
$p=13$ $$(1,11),(3,7),(4,2),(9,8),(10,5),(12,6)$$ By the ***transpose***
$X^T$ of a starter $X$ we mean those pairs in the first column of the
square generated by $X$.\
In this case, for example, $(1,11)$ goes in cell (0,12) therefore will
be a pair in the first column $(1+i,11+i)$ in position $(0+i,12+i)$,
such that $12+i = 0$ mod 13,

(2,12) goes in (1,0) hence belongs to the transpose of this starter

In general a starter-pair $(a,b)$ goes in $(0,a+b)$, so the
corresponding transpose-pair will be $(a-a-b,b-a-b) = (-b,-a)$. So the
transpose of the above starter is:
$$(2,12),(6,10),(11,9),(5,4),(8,3),(7,1)$$ If we now apply the
Schellenberg construction as suggested in [13] we obtain $P \odot Q$:

Although this is the join of two Latin squares, the repetition of
ordered pairs means that they are not orthogonal. An immediate solution
might be to reverse the order of half the repeated pairs, but this
approach ruins the join of Latin squares property.\
Anderson, has developed a theorem to overcome this property. We present
a slight adaptation of this theorem:

#### Theorem 5.5.2

[2] Let $p=8k+5$ be a prime, $p>5$. Then a $BRS$ of side $2p+1$ exists.\
\
*Proof*\
Suppose we take $P \odot Q$, and label elements of the pairs from $P$
with subscript 1 and all those from $Q$ with subscript 2. Then remove
the diagonal pairs $(a,a)$, and call this new array $A$.\
$A$ contains all the unordered pairs $\{a_1,b_1\},\{a_2,b_2\}$ exactly
once.\
The first row of $A$ contains the ordered pairs,

$(x_1^{4i},-x_1^{4i+1}),(x_1^{4i+2},-x_1^{4i+1})$ due to $P$, and\
$(x_2^{4i+1},-x_2^{4i}),(x_2^{4i+1},-x_2^{4i+2})$ due to $Q$\

So all the squares subscript 1 appear as left hand members of pairs as
do all the non-squares subscript 2. Also, all the non-squares appear
with subscript 1 in the right hand positions and all the squares with
subscript 2.\
\
If we denote the set of squares with subscript 1 by $R_1$, and with
subscript 2 by $R_2$. And similarly denote the sets of non-squares as
$N_1$ and $N_2$. Then in $A$,

$R_1 \cup N_2$ occupies the left hand positions\
while $N_1 \cup R_2$ occupies the right\

Now define $B$ as the array of side $p$ whose first row contains the
pairs:
$$(x_2^{4i},-x_1^{4i+1}),(x_1^{4i+2},x_2^{4i+1}),(-x_2^{4i},x_1^{4i+1}),(-x_1^{4i+2},-x_2^{4i+1})$$
So in $B$ the left hand positions are occupied by $R_2 \cup R_1$, while
the right are occupied by $N_1 \cup N_2$.\
In order that all unordered pairs $\{a_1,b_2\}$ occur once in $B$
requires that in the first row all the members of $GF(p)$ occur once as
a difference in one of two ways:

Either as $a_1-b_2$ which are called $(1,2)$ ***mixed differences***\
Or as $b_2 -a_1$, called (2,1) mixed differences.\

Consider $(2,1)$ mixed differences in the first row, they are:\
$x^{4i} + x^{4i+1} = x^{4i}(1+x)$\
$-x^{4i}-x^{4i+1}=-x^{4i}(1+x)$\
$x^{4i+1} - x^{4i+2} = x^{4i+1}(1-x)$\
$-x^{4i+1} + x^{4i+2} = -x^{4i+1}(1-x)$\
i.e. $\pm x^{4i}(1+x), \pm x^{4i+1}(1-x)$\
Again, these are all of $GF(p)$ provided that $x^2- 1$ is a square.\
\
Now arrange $A$ and $B$ in the following familiar manner to construct an
array of side $2p+1$:

     $A$       $\phi$         $\theta ^T$
  ---------- ---------- ------------------------
    $\phi$      $B$           $\theta ^T$
   $\theta$   $\theta$   $\infty _1, \infty _2$

Next place the missing pairs in a manner similar to the original
construction of Schellenberg. Take a pair $(a_1,b_2$ from the first row
of $B$ in position $(0_2,h_2)$ and consider the cells in transversal
$T_1$ of $B$, where
$$T_1 = \left \{((0+g)_2,(h+g)_2) \hspace{0.2cm} \middle| \hspace{0.2cm} g \in Z_p \right \}$$
If cell $(i_2,j_2)$ in $T_1$ contains $(n_1,k_2)$,

-   put $(n_1,k_2)$ in cell $(i_2,\infty)$

-   also put $(\infty _1,k_2)$ in $(k_1,j_2)$ and $(\infty _2,n_1)$ in
    $(n_1,j_2)$

Now consider the transversal $T_2$ of $B$, where $(u_1,v_2)$ is a pair
in $(0_2,l_2)$ and,
$$T_2 = \left \{((0+g)_2,(l+g)_2) \hspace{0.2cm} \middle| \hspace{0.2cm} g \in Z_p \right \}$$
If cell $(i_2,j_2)$ in $T_2$ contains $(h_1,m_2)$,

-   put $(h_1,m_2)$ in cell $(\infty,j_2)$

-   also put $(\infty _2,m_2)$ in $(0_2,m_1)$ and $(h_1,\infty _1)$ in
    $(0_2,h_1)$

Finally put $(i_1,i_2)$ in $(i_2,i_2)$ for $0 \leq i \leq p-1$, and put
$(\infty _1, \infty _2)$ in cell $(\infty, \infty )$.\

\end{array}$

**Figure 40**

Now, assemble the large array and apply the construction using the
following transversals,
$$T_1 = \{((0+g)_2,(5+g)_2)\hspace{0.2cm}|\hspace{0.2cm}g \in Z_{13}\}$$
$$T_2 = \{((0+g)_2,(11+g)_2)\hspace{0.2cm}|\hspace{0.2cm}g \in Z_{13}\}$$
The obtained array is the $BRS(28)$ in Figure 41.\
\
The finished array (Figure 41) is an $ORS$ because it contains one
ordered pair corresponding to each unordered pair from the set
$\{\infty _1, \infty _2, 0_1,...,p-1_1,0_2,...,p-1_2\}$, with each
member of the same set occurring exactly once in each row and column. To
prove that this $ORS$ is a $BRS$ we need to show that the block design
obtained from the rows in the usual way is balanced.\
\
Consider the blocks obtained from the first $p$ rows. We have shown
already that the first row of $A$ conssted of two blocks, left and right
where\
$\hspace{1cm}$ Left block: $R_1 \cup N_2$\
$\hspace{1cm}$ Right block: $N_1 \cup R_2$\
The last stage of the construction put the pairs $\{\infty _2, 0_1\}$
and $\{\infty _1,0_2\}$ in row $0_1$ of the finished array. So the
blocks obtained from the first $p$ rows are:
$$R_1 \cup N_2 \cup \{\infty _2, \infty _1 \}$$
$$N_1 \cup R_2 \cup \{0 _1, 0 _2 \}$$ and their translates.\
By similar reasoning the blocks obtained from the next $p$ rows are:
$$R_2 \cup R_1 \cup \{0 _1, \infty _2 \}$$
$$N_1 \cup N_2 \cup \{0 _2, \infty _1 \}$$ and their translates. Finally
the row labelled $\infty$ contributes a further two blocks to the
design: $\hspace{1cm} \{0_1,\infty _1\} \cup R_1 \cup N_1$ obtained from
the left hand members of pairs, and\
$\hspace{1cm} \{0_2,\infty _2\} \cup R_2 \cup N_2$ obtained from the
right hand members.\
Fortunately, Schellenberg has shown that these blocks do indeed form a
$BIBD$ with parameters,\
$(2(p+1_,p+1,p)$.\
\
To show this we consider another result due to Bose. He showed that the
blocks\
$\{\infty,x^0,x^2,...,x^{q-3}\}\{0,x^0,x^2,...,x^{q-3}\}$ form a
difference system in $GF(q)$ with $\lambda = (q-1)/2$. This result
implies that the blocks
$\{\infty, x^1,x^3,...,x^{q-2}\}\{0,x^1,x^3,...,x^{q-2}\}$ also form a
difference system with the same concurrence number.

#### Lemma 5.5.2

[4] If $q = p^n \equiv 1$(mod 4) is a prime power, then if we write down
the non-zero elements of $GF(q)$ which are squares:
$$x^0,x^2,x^4,...,x^{q-3}$$ Every non-square element of $GF(q)$ occurs
exactly $(q-1)/4$ times as a difference between these elements and every
square occurs $(q-5)/4$ times.\
\
*Proof*\
We can write the differences in the following way: $$

  ------------------------------ ----------------------------------- --------------------------------------- ----------------------
            $(x^2-1)$                     $x^{2}(x^{2}-1)$            $ \hspace{0.5cm} ... \hspace{0.5cm} $    $x^{q-3}(x^{2}-1)$
            $(x^4-1)$                     $x^{2}(x^{4}-1)$            $ \hspace{0.5cm} ... \hspace{0.5cm} $    $x^{q-3}(x^{4}-1)$
                                                                      $ \hspace{0.5cm} ... \hspace{0.5cm} $  
   $(x^{q-3}-1)\hspace{0.25cm}$   $\hspace{0.25cm}x^{2}(x^{q-3}-1)$   $ \hspace{0.5cm} ... \hspace{0.5cm} $   $x^{q-3}(x^{q-3}-1)$
  ------------------------------ ----------------------------------- --------------------------------------- ----------------------

$$ Where the first column has been obtained by substracting $x^0$ from
every other square. The second column by taking $x^2$ from every other
square, the third by taking $x^4$ and so on.\
\
Because the differences in every column except the first have an even
power of $x$ multiplied by some member of the first column it is clear
that the quadratic nature of these terms is determined by whether or not
the elements in the first column are square or not.\
\
Therefore to complete the proof we need to show that among the $(q-3)/2$
elements, $$x^2-1,x^4-1,...,x^{q-3}-1$$ every square occurs $(q-5)/4$
times and every non-square $(q-1)/4$ times. We can further simplify the
problem if we write,
$$x^{2i}-1=(x^i+1)(x^i-1)=\frac{x^i+1}{x^i-1}(x^i-1)^2$$ Then $x^{2i}-1$
is a square or non-square depending on whether:
$$z_i = \frac{x^i+1}{x^i-1}$$ is a square or not. So it remains only to
count the occurrences of squares/non-squares in the set:
$$Z=\{z_1,z_2,...,z_{(q-3)/2}\}$$ Suppose we consider instead the set,
$$A = \{z_1,z_2,...,z_{q-2}\}$$ which clearly has $q-2$ members. We can
show that each member is a unique member of $GF(q)$, because if two
different elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ were the same we would have:
$$\frac{x^i+1}{x^i-1} \equiv \frac{x^j+1}{x^j-1}(\mathrm{mod}\hspace{0.1cm} q)$$
$$(x^j-1)(x^i+1) \equiv (x^j+1)(x^i-1)\hspace{0.1cm}(\mathrm{mod}\hspace{0.1cm} q)$$
$$x^jx^i+x^j-x^i-1 \equiv x^jx^i - x^j + x^i -1\hspace{0.1cm}(\mathrm{mod}\hspace{0.1cm} q)$$
$$x^j \equiv x^i \hspace{0.1cm}(\mathrm{mod}\hspace{0.1cm} q)$$ but
$1 \leq i, j \leq q-2$, therefore the above is only satisfied if
$x^j = x^i, \therefore i=j$, which contradicts the assumption that the
two elements were different.\
Further, if $z_i \equiv -1\hspace{0.1cm}(\mathrm{mod}\hspace{0.1cm} q)$
then $x^i+1 = -x^i+1$, which implies $x^i=0$. So $-1 \notin A$. Recall
that when $q \equiv 1\hspace{0.1cm}(\mathrm{mod}\hspace{0.1cm} 4)$, $-1$
is a square.\
Also, if $z_i \equiv -1\hspace{0.1cm}(\mathrm{mod}\hspace{0.1cm} q)$
then $x^i+1=x^i-1$, so $1 \notin A$. 1 is a square.\
Finally, $x^{q-1/2}=-1$, therefore $z_{q-1/2}=0$.\
Clearly, then $A=GF(q) \backslash \{1,-1\}$, and
$A \backslash \{z_{q-1/2}\}
= GF(q) \backslash \{0,1,-1\}$, so $A \backslash \{z_{q-1/2}\}$ contains
$(q-1)/2$ non-squares and $(q-5)/2$ squares.
$$A \backslash \{z_{(q-1)/2}\}=\{z_1,z_2,...,z_{(q-3)/2},z_{(q+1)/2},z_{(q+3)/2},...,z_{q-2}\}$$
But,
$$z_{\{(q+1)/2\}+k} = \frac{x^{\{(q+1)/2\}+k}+1}{x^{\{(q+1)/2\}+k}-1}
= \frac{-x^k+1}{-x^k-1} = \frac{1}{z^k} \hspace{0.5cm} k = 1,2,...,(q-3)/2$$
So $z_{\{(q+1)/2\}+k}$ and $z_k$ $[ k = 1,2,...,(q-3)/2]$ are both
squares or both non-squares, hence $Z=\{z_1,z_2,...,z_{(q-3)/2}\}$
contains exactly $(q-1)/4$ non-squares and $(q-5)/4$ squares. So the
lemma is proven.

#### Corollary 5.5.2

If $q = p^n \equiv 1$(mod 4) is a prime power, then if we write down the
non-zero elements of $GF(q)$ which are non-squares:
$$x^1,x^3,x^5,...,x^{q-2}$$ Every square element of $GF(q)$ occurs
exactly $(q-1)/4$ times as a difference between these elements and every
non-square occurs $(q-5)/4$ times.\
\
*Proof*\
As for the previous theorem except that each difference is multiplied by
$x$, so squares become non-squares and non-squares, squares.

#### Theorem 5.5.3

[4] The blocks
$$\{\infty,x^0,x^2,...,x^{q-3}\}\{0,x^0,x^2,...,x^{q-3}\}$$ along with
their translates, form a $BIBD$ with $\lambda = (q-1)/2$ in $GF(q)$,
when $q = p^n \equiv 1$(mod 4).\
\
*Proof*\
From the Lemma we have shown that in the set
$$\{x^0,x^2,x^4,...,x^{q-3}\}$$ each square occurs as a difference
$(q-5)/4$ times, and each non-square $(q-1)/4$ times. The right hand
block also contributes the differences
$$x^0-0,0-x^0,1-x^2,x^2-1,...,x^{q-3}-0,0-x^{q-3}$$
$$\pm x^0, \pm x^2, ... ,\pm x^{q-3}$$ And because $-1$ is a square,
each square of $GF(q)$ occurs a further twice due to these differences.

                 $\{\infty,x^0,x^2,...,x^{q-3}\}$   $\{0,x^0,x^2,...,x^{q-3}$     Total
  ------------- ---------------------------------- --------------------------- -----------
     Squares                $(q-5)/4$                    $\{(q-5)/4\}+2$        $(q-1)/2$
   Non-squares              $(q-1)/4$                       $(q-1)/4$           $(q-1)/2$

**Table 10**

Adjoining $\infty$ to a block of size $(q-1)/2$ creates $(q-1)/2$ pairs
involving $\infty$. Therefore in $\{\infty,x^0,x^2,...,x^{q-3}\}$ and
the translates obtained from this block $\infty$ makes a pair with each
member of $GF(q)$, $(q-1)/2$ times.\
Therefore the block design obtained from these two blocks is balanced,
and the concurrence number is $\lambda = (q-1)/2$.\
\
Although we donâ€™t need the following result, it now follows
straightforwardly from Corollary 5.4.2.

#### Corollory 5.5.3

[4] The blocks,
$$\{\infty,x^1,x^3,...,x^{q-2}\}\{0,x^1,x^3,...,x^{q-2}\}$$ along with
their translates, form a $BIBD$ with $\lambda = (q-1)/2$ in $GF(q)$,
when $q = p^n \equiv 1$(mod 4).\
\
Now returning to the Anderson construction:\
Let: $$S = R_1 \cup N_2 \cup \{\infty _2, \infty _1\}$$
$$T = N_1 \cup R_2 \cup \{0_1, 0_2\}$$
$$U = N_1 \cup N_2 \cup \{0 _2, \infty _1\}$$
$$V = R_2 \cup R_1 \cup \{0_1, \infty _2\}$$ Now consider the pairs
$\{a_1,b_1\}$ such that $a,b \in GF(q) \cup \{\infty\}$. We know, due to
the Bose result, that the blocks\
$\{\infty _1\} \cup R_1$ and $0 _1\} \cup R_1$ along with their
translates contain each pair $\{a_1,b_1\}$, $(q-1)/2$ times,\
also\
$\{\infty _1\} \cup N_1$ and $0 _1\} \cup N_1$ and translates contain
each pair $\{a_1,b_1\}$, $(q-1)/2$ times.\
But,
$$\{\infty _1\} \cup R_1 \subset R_1 \cup N_2 \cup \{\infty _1, \infty _2\}$$
$$\{\infty _1\} \cup N_1 \subset N_1 \cup R_2 \cup \{0_1, 0_2\}$$
Therefore $S$ and $T$, along with their translates, contain each pair
$\{a_1,b_1\}, 2\cdot (q-1)/2 = q-1$, times. Finally each pair
$\{a_1,b_1\}$ occurs once more in the set
$\{\infty _1,0_1\} \cup R_1 \cup N_1$. So in the entire block design
each pair $\{a_1,b_1\}$ occurs $q$ times.\
The same reasoning can be applied to show that the pairs $\{a_2,b_2\}$
for $a,b \in GF(q) \cup \{\infty\}$ also occur $q$ times in the block
design.\
It remains to show that the mixed pairs of the form $\{a_1,b_2\}$, where
$a,b \in GF(q) \cup \{\infty\}$, also occur $q$ times in the block
design. Again we consider (1,2) mixed differences.\
For a pair $\{a_1,a_2\}$ to occur in the block design requires a mixed
difference of 0 in either $S$, $T$, $U$ or $V$.\
In $T$, $0_1-0_2 = 0$, gives one occurrence, while in $U$\
 $ \left.
\begin{tabular}{l l}
$x~1~^1^$ & $-x~2~^1^$\\
$x~1~^3^$ & $-x~2~^3^$\\
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\vdots} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\vdots}\\
$x^q-2^~1~$ & $-x~2~^q-2^$\\
\end{tabular}
\right \} $ gives $(q-1)/2$ occurrences of 0, and similarly $V$,\
\
 $ \left.
\begin{tabular}{l l}
$x~1~^0^$ & $-x~2~^0^$\\
$x~1~^2^$ & $-x~2~^2^$\\
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\vdots} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\vdots}\\
$x^q-3^~1~$ & $-x~2~^q-3^$\\
\end{tabular}
\right \} $ gives another $(q-1)/2$ occurrences of 0 as a mixed
difference.\
\
Therefore, 0 occurs as mixed difference in $S,T,U$ and $V$
$(2\cdot (q-1)/2)+1=q$ times, therefore each pair of the form
$\{a_1,a_2\}$, occurs $q$ times in the block design.\
\
Next, consider pairs of the form $\{\infty _1, b_2\}$. In $S$ and $U$,
$\infty _1$ makes a pair with each of the $(q-1)/2$ members of $N_2$.
Therefore in the blocks consisting of $S$, $U$ and their translates,
$\infty _1$ makes a pair with each element $b_2$ [for all $b \in GF(q)$]
$2 \cdot (q-1)/2 = q-1$ times. Also in $U$, $\infty _1$ is paired with
$0_2$, so $\infty _1$ makes a pair with each $b_2$ once more. So there
are $q$ pairs $\{\infty _1,b_2\}$ for each element $b_2$ in the block
design.\
\
By identical reasoning we can say that $\infty _2$ makes a pair with
each $b_1$, for all $b \in GF(q)$, $(q-1)/2$ times in $S$ and its
translates. Also $\{\infty _2,b_1\}$ [for all $b \in GF(q)$] occurs
$(q+1)/2$ times due to $V$ and its translates.\
Therefore the pairs $\{\infty _2, b_1 \}$ each occur $q$ times in the
block design, for all $b \in GF(q)$.\
\
Next we confirm that all the pairs $\{a_1,b_2\}$ $a,b \in GF(q)$ each
occur $q$ times in the block design. In order to do this we need to show
that the non-zero members of $GF(q)$ each occur $q$ times as a mixed
difference $a_1 - b_2$.\
We have shown that for $q \equiv 1($mod 4)

1.  every square, non-square occurs as a difference of two squares of
    $GF(q)$, $s-1$, $s$ times respectively. $s = (q-1)/4$.

2.  every square, non-square occurs as a difference of non-two squares
    of $GF(q)$, $s$, $s-1$ times respectively.

Consider first the mixed differences $a_1-b_2 = c$, where $c$ is a
square.\
$U$ contains $N_1 \cup N_2$, so according to $B$ every square occurs as
a (1,2) difference $(q-1)/4$ times in $U$. Also according to $B$ each
non-square occurs as a (1,2) difference between members of $U$,
$(q-5)/4$ times. Finally, $U$ contains the element $0_2$, so each
non-square is generated once more.
$x_1^1-0_2=x^1_1,x_1^3-0_2=x_1^3,...,x_1^{q-2}-0_2=x_1^{q-2}$.\
Similarly, in $V$ each non-square occurs as a mixed difference $(q-1)/4$
times while each square occurs as a difference $(q-5)/4_1$ times.\
Next, consider blocks $S$ and $T$. In $T$ each square/non-square exists
as a mixed difference once, in the following way: $$

  ------------- -------- ------------
  $x_1^1$       $-0_2$   $=x^1$
  $x_1^3$       $-0_2$   $=x^3$
                         
  $x^{q-2}_1$   $-0_2$   $=x^{q-2}$
  ------------- -------- ------------

  ------------- -------- ------------
  $x_2^0$       $-0_1$   $=x^0$
  $x_2^2$       $-0_1$   $=x^2$
                         
  $x^{q-3}_2$   $-0_1$   $=x^{q-3}$
  ------------- -------- ------------

The remaining mixed differences in $S$ and $T$ all involve
differences between one square and one non-square (and vice versa). Now,
for any $c \in GF(q)$, $a-b=c$ has $q$ solutions. Two of these,
$$a=0-(-a)$$ $$a=a-0$$ involve zero, and can be rejected because we have
already considered all differences involving 0 in these blocks. Further,
from $A$ and $B$, we know there are $(q-5)/4 + (q-1)/4 = (q-3)/2$
solutions which involve either both squares or both non-squares, and so
there remain $$(q-2)-[(q-3)/2] = (q-1)/2$$ solutions which involve
elements of opposite quadratic character. Hence we can say that each
square, non-square occurs as a difference in $S$ and $T$ in $(q-1)/2+1$
ways.

<span>|c|c|c|</span> &\
& c=square & c = nonsquare\
S & &\
 T & &\
U & & +1\
V & +1 &\
 & q & q\

Which confirms that each pair $\{a_1,b_2\}$ for
$a,b \in GF(a) \cup \{\infty\}$ appears in $q$ blocks of the block
design.\
So every pair $\{a,b\}$,
$a,b \in GF(q)_1 \cup GF(q)_2 \cup \{\infty _1, \infty _2\}, a \neq b$
appears in $q$ blocks of the block design. Hence that design is a
$BIBD$, with parameters $(2(q+1),q+1,q)$.\
So theorem 5.5.2 is established.
